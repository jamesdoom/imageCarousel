Create a basic image carousel. Arrows on the left and right will be used to move the images forward and backward.
The images should automatically move every 5 seconds. A small navigation circles should be at the bottom to indicate which image
you are currently on and they should be clickable to allow the user to click on that particular image.
I would like 1 HTML file, 1 JavaScript file, and 1 CSS file. Thank you.
